AIN4002 Assignment 1 2019
Your task for this assignment is to train a model to perform linear regression, using Python. The purpose of this model is to predict the Percentage achieved in a subject when a student spends a specific amount of minutes studying. To complete this task, you need to do the following:
1. Consult the DataSetStudentNumber.pdf file to determine which Data Set and set of Extra Instructions you need to use to complete your assignment.
2. Download the DataSets.zip file and find the file number associated with your student number.
3. Download the Extras.zip file and find the file number associated with your student number.
4. Use the entire dataset to train the linear regression model. Name your Python file as your student number, 11111111.py.
5. Use the instructions from the Extra instructions file to determine what other outputs are required for your assignment.
6. Download the Submission Template.csv file and fill in the required values. Ensure that the Submission Template file is delimited by “;”. Name your Submission Template file as your student number before submission, e.g. 11111111.csv. Compare your .csv file to the Example Submission.csv file to make sure your submission is in the correct format.
7. Submit both your .py and .csv files on the Moodle site in the (2 separate) upload slots provided.
8. Your Python script must clearly show how all the values in the submission .csv file have been calculated. Use comments to indicate where important values are calculated.
